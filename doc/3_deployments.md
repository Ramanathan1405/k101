# Deployments Overview
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/

Deployments represent a set of multiple, identical Pods with no unique identities. 
A Deployment runs multiple replicas of your application and automatically replaces any instances that fail or become unresponsive. This enables reliable zero downtime deployments.
Deployments are managed by the Kubernetes Deployment controller. A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. 

In a web browser tab navigate to https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml

A file was downloaded, lets open it and have a look.

Lets create an nginx deployment with that yaml

    kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml
   

Now check if the deployment was applied

    kubectl get deployments    
    
    NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
    nginx-deployment   10/10   10           10          42m

Deployment object encapsulates ReplicaSet and Pod objects
![Deployment Object Structure](images/deployment-object.png?raw=true "Deployment Object Structure ")
    
Edit the deployment yaml on the cluster  The selector field defines how the Deployment finds which Pods to manage. 
In this case, you simply select a label that is defined in the Pod template

    kubectl edit deployments nginx-deployment

# Replica Sets
A ReplicaSetâ€™s purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. 
As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

Check the current running pods
    
    kubectl get pods -o wide
 
Now try deleting a pod. Copy and paste one of your pods listed into the following delete command

    kubectl delete pod **********
 
Now Check the running pods again. What has happened?
    
    kubectl get pods -o wide

Let's check the current deployed ReplicaSets

     kubectl get rs

# Deployment Features
You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. 
You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.
- Upgrade
- Rollback
- Scale up or Down
- Pause and resume


# Types of Deployment Update Strategies

## Recreate Strategy
Shut down version A, then start version B. Best for development environment

Pros:
 - application state entirely renewed
 
Cons:
 - downtime that depends on both shutdown and boot duration of the application

## RollingUpdate Strategy
This uses the RollingUpdate strategy provided by kubernetes. Default strategy.    

Pros:
- No downtime
- Rollback functionality
- Better control

Cons:
- Takes time

![Rollout Example](images/rollout-example.png?raw=true "Rollout Example")   

Lets scale up the cluster, if not using a local Kube cluster please refrain from scaling to a large number as your cluster may get sluggish. 

    kubectl scale  deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment --replicas=10
    
Lets take a look at our pods, did they scale up?

    kubectl get pods -o wide

Take a look at the deployment description. Take note of the events

    kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment
    
First lets have a look at the current image defined in the deployment. 

    kubectl edit deployments nginx-deployment
    
Look for the number of replicas under the spec parent. Manually edit maxSurge and maxUnavailable to 10% 
Also lets set progressDeadlineSeconds to 60
Now save the file with :x or :wq 

     spec:
       progressDeadlineSeconds: 60    (How long the rollout will wait until marking the rollout status as ProgressDeadlineExceeded )
       replicas: 10 
       revisionHistoryLimit: 10
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: nginx
       strategy:
         rollingUpdate:
           maxSurge: 10%
           maxUnavailable: 10%
         type: RollingUpdate

Okay we have set our update configuration. Now lets trigger a rolling upgrade which will avoid downtime. 
We will update the docker image version on nginx in our deployment. 
We can set the image version using kubectl command. This could be done by editing the yaml directly either. 
This action will kick off a rolling update and the Kube API will detect the desired version is not set.

    kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.1

Be quick!  lets check the status. The more replicas defined the longer the rollout will take. 

    kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment
    
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 4 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 4 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 4 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 4 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 4 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 5 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 5 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 5 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 5 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 6 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 6 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 6 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 6 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 7 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 7 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...

Okay lets break some stuff :0 
Set a new nginx image to something random to try pull a docker image version that does not exist 

      kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.9.10000000

Check the pods. Look for errors. What do you see?

      kubectl get pods -o wide

Check the rollout status again 
    
    kubectl rollout status deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment

We can see the rollout has stopped as it has passsed the timeout limit we set   
    
    Waiting for deployment "nginx-deployment" rollout to finish: 2 out of 10 new replicas have been updated...
    error: deployment "nginx-deployment" exceeded its progress deadline
    
We can check the rollout history 

    kubectl rollout history deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment

If something has gone wrong in the update to the new docker image, we can undo the update
     
    kubectl rollout undo  deployment.v1.apps/nginx-deployment 
  

For the curious, Kubernetes Deployment controller code. This is used to manger the desired state
